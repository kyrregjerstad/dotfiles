# Global Claude Config

- When reporting information to me, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of consision.
- Never run the dev server, unless your are specifically told to do so, it's most likely already running in a different process.
- Only ever write comments if the code is difficult to understand, Explain WHY something happens, not how. The code should otherwise be self-explanatory.
- Do not add large comment dividers in files.

## Plans

- Make the plan extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.
